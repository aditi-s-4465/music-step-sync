# music-step-sync

A mobile app that detects steps per minute (SPM) and synchronizes music from their Spotify library with similar beats per minute (BPM) in real time. The goal is to make a fun fitness app that motivates people to stay on pace during their workout.

## Setup

- install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Install [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install ESLint VScode [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - This will allow for auto fixing styling issues and alerting you of errors within the VScode IDE
- Fork this repository to your personal repo, you can see a tutorial for that [here](https://coda.io/@ethan-grinberg/sigchi/git-26)
- git clone from your personal repo `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/music-step-sync.git`
- cd into the directory where you cloned the repo `cd music-step-sync`
- to install the project dependencies run `npm install`

## Local Development

- Search `Expo Go` in your app store and download it
- Start the development server with `npm start`
  - this will compile the react native app using [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/more/expo-cli/)
- scan the QR code that comes up from the terminal and you should get a link that opens up in the Expo Go app
- now you can make changes to your code and they should live update in the Expo Go app

Once you make changes open a pull request to merge from your forked repository to the SIGCHI repository.
